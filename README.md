# PROJECT
Webpage that stores a repository of observations made by users. It also implements authentication and authorisation.
Users are created and assigned a role.
Sensitive user details (such as passwords) are hashed using bcrypt.
They can login with their username and password.
After login is authenticated, users are directed to their dashboards based on their "roles"
Other actions such as creating observations, viewing observations, et al are implemented.
Improvements and collaborators are welcome.
